# Phase 3: Automatic Hooks (PENDING Detection) – Current State and Testing

## Summary
- **Default (stable)**: Hybrid architecture combining network detection + automatic hooks
- **Network Detection**: WORKING/IDLE states via fetch interception (Phase 1/2)
- **Automatic Hooks**: PENDING states via automatic `.claude/settings.local.json` setup
- **SDK Mode**: Deprecated (was broken, replaced by hooks approach)
- **Architecture**: Both systems run in parallel, detecting different state transitions

## Testing Commands

### Basic Functionality Tests
```bash
# Test automatic hook setup
rm -f .claude/settings.local.json
./tools/tallr claude --print "hello"
cat .claude/settings.local.json  # Should show Tallr hooks

# Test network detection (WORKING/IDLE)
DEBUG=tallr:network ./tools/tallr claude --print "hello"
# Expect: fetch-start → WORKING, fetch-end → IDLE
```

### PENDING State Testing
```bash
# Test PENDING detection with tool use
DEBUG=tallr:state ./tools/tallr claude
# In Claude: "Please read the file package.json"
# Expect: PENDING state when Claude asks for file permission

# Test complete state cycle
./tools/tallr claude
# Ask: "Read package.json and explain this project"
# Expect: IDLE → WORKING → PENDING → WORKING → IDLE
```

### Hook Preservation Testing
```bash
# Test non-destructive hook setup
mkdir -p .claude
echo '{"hooks": {"Custom": "echo test"}}' > .claude/settings.local.json
./tools/tallr claude --print "hello"
cat .claude/settings.local.json | jq '.hooks'
# Should show both Custom and Tallr hooks preserved
```

## Implementation Notes
- **Automatic Setup**: Hooks are created automatically when Tallr starts
- **Non-Destructive**: Existing user hooks are preserved
- **Direct Communication**: Hooks send HTTP requests directly to Tallr backend
- **No Manual Configuration**: No `.claude/settings.local.json` setup required
- **Fallback Support**: Pattern detection remains available if network detection fails
